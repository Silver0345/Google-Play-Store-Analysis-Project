### Problem statement.

Today, 1.85 million different apps are available for users to download. Android users have even more from which to choose, with 2.56 million available through the Google Play Store. These apps have come to play a huge role in the way we live our lives today. The objective is to find the Most Popular Category, the App with the largest number of installs, the App with the largest size, etc.
